Assumptions / shortcuts / notes.

I wasted plenty of time getting my visual studio up to date.
I cannot imagine the head ache to update my MSSQL. I'll accept the blame.
Thus, I used an in memory database. Sorry. (not sorry.)

Since it was not clearly stated I didn't go into the depth of the 
'Zero to Many' Relationships between Artist / Album / Song in that,
More correct methods would be added to expand the functionality of the web API.
Such methods would include for example an "AddSong" to the Album Model. 

If you'd like to come back with a more robust set of requirements I'm all ears.
